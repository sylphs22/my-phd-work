# my-phd-work

The repo has mostly works and projects that I have done during my phd on recommendation systems. Mostly they are matrix factorization codes that I have developed for recommendation and ranking. I call them **cosine based latent factor models** and shown their performance over RSVD algorithms. The codes are not very clean and they may not be usable for others but gives an idea of the algorithms implemented. 

I must thank Abhishek Srivastava PhD(FPM) IIM Ranchi in helping to write c++ codes.
